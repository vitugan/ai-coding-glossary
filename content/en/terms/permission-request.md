What the [harness](./harness.md) shows the user before executing a [tool call](./tool-call.md) that isn't pre-approved. The [model](./model.md) produces a tool call; instead of running it immediately, the harness pauses and asks. Approve and it runs; deny and the harness reports the denial back to the model as a [tool result](./tool-result.md). The mechanism by which a harness puts a human in the [loop](./human-in-the-loop.md) for risky or sensitive actions.

The lifecycle of a permission request:

| Step | Who     | What happens                                                                          |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Model   | Produces a tool call                                                                  |
| 2    | Harness | Checks it against the [permission mode](./permission-mode.md) and any saved approvals |
| 3    | Harness | Pre-approved: executes immediately. Otherwise: pauses and shows the request           |
| 4    | User    | Approves once, approves for the rest of the [session](./session.md), or denies        |
| 5    | Harness | Executes the call, or sends the denial back as a tool result                          |

Denying a request steers the agent. The model reads the denial like any other tool result and reacts to it — it tries a different approach, or asks what you'd prefer. Most harnesses let you attach a message to the denial, which turns the request into a steering point: "not like that, use the migration script instead" lands exactly when the model is deciding what to do next.

The cost is that every request is a synchronous wait on you. The [agent](./agent.md) sits blocked until you answer, which is fine while you're watching and a problem when you're not — an agent that triggers requests constantly can't be left to work [AFK](./afk.md). The permission mode is the dial: which calls run freely, which ask first, ideally with a [sandbox](./sandbox.md) making it safe to widen the free set.

## usage

"It's been blocked on a permission request for ten minutes — I was in a meeting."

"That's the cost of human-in-the-loop. Pre-approve the safe [tools](./tool.md) so the request only fires on the actually-risky calls."
