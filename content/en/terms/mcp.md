**Model Context Protocol.** A protocol for plugging external tool servers into a [harness](./harness.md) — how an [agent](./agent.md) gets [tools](./tool.md) beyond what the harness ships with. The agent never "calls MCP"; it calls a tool, and the harness happens to have gotten that tool from an MCP server. Also exposes resources (read-only data) and prompts (reusable templates), but tool provision is the primary use.

The protocol solves an integration problem. Without a standard, every harness would need its own Linear integration, its own Slack integration, its own database integration — written and maintained separately for each. With MCP, the integration is written once as a server, and any MCP-compatible harness can use it. The harness connects to the server, the server advertises what tools it offers, and those tools become available to the agent alongside the built-in ones.

The cost is paid in [context](./context.md). Every tool a server advertises arrives as a definition — name, description, parameter schema — and the [model](./model.md) can only call tools it knows about. The naive approach loads every definition into the [context window](./context-window.md) up front: install a few generous servers and a [session](./session.md) starts with thousands of [tokens](./token.md) of tool schemas before you've typed anything, spending [attention budget](./attention-budget.md) on tools the task will never use.

Many harnesses now mitigate this with tool search: instead of the full definitions, the context holds a [context pointer](./context-pointer.md) to the available tools — the agent searches for a tool by name or purpose and loads its definition only when it needs it. If your harness doesn't do this, the up-front cost still applies, and it's worth enabling only the servers a project actually needs.

## usage

"The agent needs to read tickets from Linear."

"Configure the harness to use the Linear MCP server — it exposes the Linear API as tools the agent can call. Saves you writing custom tool wrappers."
