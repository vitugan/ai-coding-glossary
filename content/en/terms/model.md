The [parameters](./parameters.md). [Stateless](./stateless.md) — does [next-token prediction](./next-token-prediction.md) and nothing else. "Claude Opus 4.x" and "GPT-5.x" are models. On its own a model can't do anything agentic; it has to be [harnessed](./harness.md).

Models can't read files, run commands, browse the web, or remember yesterday — it takes [tokens](./token.md) in and predicts tokens out, once per [model provider request](./model-provider-request.md). Everything that feels like an [agent](./agent.md) working — choosing [tools](./tool.md), reading results, looping until the task is done — is the harness orchestrating many of those predictions in a row.

[Model providers](./model-provider.md) ship models in tiers: a large one that's smartest but slow and expensive, and smaller ones that are faster and cheaper but less capable. Picking a tier is a real decision — heavyweight for planning and hard debugging, lightweight for mechanical changes — and harnesses let you switch mid-[session](./session.md).

Being strict about the word also sharpens diagnosis. "The model is bad at this" is a specific claim — the same model in a different harness, or with a different [context](./context.md), often behaves completely differently. Before blaming the model, check what it was given: most disappointing output traces back to context or harness, not parameters.

## usage

"Should we switch the model from Sonnet to Opus for the planning step?"

"Try it — but the harness is doing most of the lifting on this task. The model swap won't help if the [system prompt](./system-prompt.md) and tools are wrong."
